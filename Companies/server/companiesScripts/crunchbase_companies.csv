When applied to apps on app stores the SAGScore™ gives a software consumer visibility into the trustworthiness of each app, which can help consumers decide which app to install from a set of search results, based on the highest SAGScore™. These seven steps implement best practices to augment NERC CIP-010-3 software verification standards by applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework V1.1 and the NTIA Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) standards recognized by the Department of Commerce NTIA SBOM initiative. The May 12, 2021 Cybersecurity Executive Order, 14028, mandates that Federal Agencies and Departments require all software vendors of critical software to provide SBOM's as part of their software product distributions. An SBOM will enable Federal buyers of software products to conduct a software risk assessment, using SAG-PM™, to determine the trustworthiness of a software package, prior to installation. This ""proactive"" risk assessment can detect harmful malware, such a ransomware and other nefarious software, preventing it from being installed in a digital ecosystem, where it can cause damages. An AWS cloud based SAGServer™ provides database and other support services to the SAG-PM™ software application, including a List of Trusted Software Objects in the SAG-CTR™ Community Trust Registry along with their SAGScore™, that have been digitally signed, which the SAG-PM™ user community has identified as trustworthy. Software products that receive multiple trust registrations from the SAG-PM™ end user community can receive the SAG-STAR™ label to indicate their high level achievement of trustworthiness. The new SEC cybersecurity rules are placing more responsibility, and liability for cybersecurity controls/protections on Officers and Directors. The SAG-CTR includes a ""Secure Evidence Locker"" where tamper-proof evidence of proactive cybersecurity controls to monitor for CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability (KEV) risks in software assets is stored to aid Officers and Directors in mounting a defense against any shareholder lawsuits, in the event of a cyber-incident, that must be report within 96 hours under the SEC Cybersecurity rules that go into effect December 2023. The SAG user documentation also includes an appendix containing a description of processes, policies and practices for cyber-risk detection and risk management in the software Supply Chain, i.e., CISA KEV's,needed for disclosure to the SEC, starting in December 2023. REA has open-sourced its, free to use, Vendor Response File Format and Vulnerability Disclosure Report XML schemas to help software vendors and consumers exchange critical information required to meet Executive Order 14028 and the new ""SBOM Bill"" making its way through Congress, H.R. 4611; A sample use case showing all required evidence data for a comprehensive risk assessment is available online at: https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/tree/master/C-SCRM-Use-Case open source XML VRF and NIST Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) schemas are available here: https://github.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products REA is a proud member of the IEEE Entrepreneurship program and an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Activate partner.

Product life cycle management involves making design decisions based on multiple criteria including cost, compliance, sustainability, and risk. Unfortunately, the data and expertise required to make these decisions are siloed. This protracts the process of innovation and increases its complexity. Today, the market solves this problem with vertical applications like PDM, ERP, CAD, EHS, SCM, etc. These mostly remain siloed due to the enormous costs of integration and keeping data synchronized. Therefore, analyses typically require exporting data to aggregation tools e.g. BI or excel before being used for analyses in specialist decision support applications. Results are typically delayed, some taking as much as 9 months, and therefore provide little support during the design process. Makersite provides results instantly and simultaneously across key product criteria. Makersite combines external and internal data sources to create a digital twin of a product in design. Artificial intelligence and its graph-based data model allow for ingesting, representing, and connecting heterogeneous data easily. Its native applications use algorithms to support analysis and decision-making based on multiple criteria simultaneously including should-costs, regulatory compliance, life cycle impacts (LCA), supply chain risk, etc. The API-first architecture allows for easy integrations into existing IT infrastructures thereby supporting systems and processes with richer, fresher, and more timely product data. This allows engineers to understand and improve their designs from the perspective of their regulatory compliance, environmental impact, supply risk, and cost of production, simultaneously. Companies can get results up to 40x faster than traditional methods while making their products better.","Makersite is a cloud-based product data management tool that helps companies manage product sustainability, cost, and compliance.","Translink Capital, KOMPAS VC, EASME - EU Executive Agency for SMEs, Hitachi Ventures, Planet A Ventures",Series A,"€18,200,000","€18,200,000",51-100,"Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg,",14,2018

The proliferation of connected devices promises to revolutionize consumer, commercial and industrial applications with greater convenience, lower operational costs and data-driven performance improvements. Already consumers have fallen in love with smart home conveniences, while many businesses have begun to reap the benefits of connected device driven efficiency gains such as electronic shelf labels and occupancy sensors. Giga scale applications for these technologies are around the corner: the potential exists for billions of wireless sensors to be installed during the coming decade, with nearly half located inside buildings. However, the challenge of reliably and affordably powering these devices has continued to limit IoT viability at scale. Connected electronics require continuous power, which until now has meant batteries that must be periodically replaced or recharged. Legacy photovoltaic technologies like amorphous silicon cells long used on solar calculators and childrens toys don’t yield sufficient power in the real-world, low light operational conditions for most IoT sensors. At the same time, the exorbitant price tag for high performance, low-light PV technologies like gallium arsenide cells has made them suitable only for space satellite and research applications, not mass-market electronics. Ambient has solved both the low power density and high cost problems of legacy low light PV technologies and created the world’s most powerful low light energy harvesting photovoltaic cells - making endless power for IoT electronics a reality for the first time.","Ambient Photonics is a low light energy harvesting PV cells for smart home, consumer electronics, and IoT devices.","Trinity Capital, I Squared Capital, Silicon Valley Bank, Helios Climate Ventures, Climate Pledge Fund",Series A,"$30,000,000","$61,000,000",51-100,"Scotts Valley, California, United States",60,Apr 2019

There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost. Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential... but also the pain! To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook attribution), giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality. We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources: a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one. So we decided to build one ourselves. Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies who have the ambition to be truly data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis. Dreamdata integrates with just about any commercial tool and traffic source, so your teams won’t be forced to use certain vendors or suites. You’re free to use best-in-class tools! What if you were asked to double next year's ad spend? What if a pandemic strikes and you’re suddenly forced to cut your marketing activities by 50%? What would you do? Do you actually trust your data enough to present a sound way forward? In situations like these, there’s nothing more dangerous than bad data. What might look like a good plan you want to act on can actually be a bad decision in disguise. Is your B2B’s data prepared and ready to go? By taking care of all the data-crunching, Dreamdata allows demand generation and commercial ops professionals to focus on which B2B go-to-market (GTM) efforts are actually paying off and enables them to repeat the success and stop wasting money. Our out-of-the-box platform helps you to answer vital B2B marketing questions like which campaigns and channels to stop or scale, what’s the return on ad spend, and how long it takes to acquire new customers. If you’re all about granularity it’s even possible to do attribution to (and between!) every pipeline stage as well. Applying attribution to pipeline stages allows Dreamdata customers to optimize every step of their customer journeys. With the Dreamdata insights, B2B marketing and sales align like never before. B2Bs need to realize that revenue creation is most effective when it’s done as a team effort. Every touch of every deal is disclosed. No more guesswork. No more opinions. With this unrivaled transparency, it’s not unusual to see campaign effectiveness and marketing ROI improve by more than 50%.",Dreamdata is a B2B revenue automation platform.

SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable.

The service includes custom screening questions, and fraud detection to ensure the jobseeker’s resume is not fake or exaggerated. The service is available via API as well as with an embeddable javascript widget, for websites with job postings and career pages. Number 1 Problem in Hiring The number one problem in hiring is finding suitable, high scoring candidates. Geescore scores, matches and engages with jobseekers before they apply, and even if they don’t apply. You can try the jobseeker scoring service for yourself at https://myjobscore.com Proof of Awesomeness Every time a jobseeker is scored they are given a free downloadable PDF called “the proof of awesomeness” with all the information related to their score, ready to be sent in with a resume when applying for the job. The PDF is a handy resource perfect for hiring managers to review the jobseeker’s score, link to their LinkedIn profile, download the resume, and more. Validated No Bias Scoring Every day we test and verify that the Geescore scoring service is operating properly, and accurately scoring jobseekers without bias. We do not use data that could create bias in the scoring service, for example; ethnicity, religion, age, race, country of origin, post-hiring data and more. Easy to Use API and built-in dashboards Geescore operates in both the front-end and back-end. This means a hiring manager can access a built-in dashboard right inside a job posting to review the Scoring Metagraph, sort jobseeker scores, and more. They can also access the Scoring Metagraph via open API ready for integration to any platform to access data, analytics, scoring, custom scoring and fraud detection. The Bottom Line - how Geescore helps Recruiters and Hiring Managers The emergence of AI tools for jobseekers to fake or exaggerate a resume, and then to apply to hundreds of jobs automatically, is creating serious challenges for Recruiters and Hiring Managers. Today, with these AI tools, the number could be only 1 in a 1,000 applications, that come from qualified candidates. Seeing a validated score for a jobseeker, instantly gives Recruiters and Hiring Managers a great advantage. They can identify and direct their focus on to the best candidates, with “high touch” attention, in an effort to beat the competition; all trying to hire the best. Geescore reduces the cost and workload of Recruiters and Hiring Managers. AI is creating a lot more work for Recruiters and Hiring Managers - such as more reference checks, more interviews, longer probationary periods and signed undertakings from applicants. The Bottom Line - how Geescore helps Jobseekers Submitting an application doesn’t guarantee a job offer. In fact, hiring companies are adding defensive measures to combat AI based fake and exaggerated resumes, and auto apply tools. Why not just apply to a lot of jobs? A Jobseeker looking to advance through interviews, should focus on opportunities where they are a good fit. Where they get a high score. A jobseeker needs to have the experience and qualifications to get through interviews, and the hiring process. Knowing their score, helps the jobseeker identify their best opportunities, and then frees up the time to research the company and opportunity, to prepare for interviews, and to network with people who can support their job application.","Geescore™ & My Jobscore use AI to score and match Jobseekers in job posts, job search, career pages and brand fan sites.",,Seed,—,—,11-50,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",2,"Mar 5, 2021"

To address this challenge, we have developed SiaSearch the category-leading search engine for petabyte-scale automotive data. Our technology automatically structures raw sensor data based on semantic attributes and keywords such as cut-ins, crowded intersections or dangerous overtaking. This metadata is powerful. By searching it, we can eliminate the time wasted on manual data crawling, automate the decision of what data to store and provide intelligent suggestions of what data would be most valuable to collect.

We uniquely address the largest unmet need in CSF Management; the high rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt occlusion. VP shunts fail at a rate of 50% within 2 years and 80% within 5 years, contributing to repeat revision brain surgeries (each costing upwards of $40,000). Conceptualized in 2014 in collaboration with Boston Children’s Hospital and spun out of Alcyone Therapeutics in 2018, Anuncia’s patented portfolio of technologies provide peace-of-mind through innovation to improve daily quality of life for the millions of underserved patients with hydrocephalus and other CSF disorders and their families, who suffer from the clinical, economic, and emotional burden of repeat revision brain surgery due to VP shunt occlusions. Anuncia’s core platform has an elegant mechanism of action using a simple finger depression of a soft silicone dome located under the patient’s scalp to produce a noninvasive, retrograde flush of the patient’s own CSF to restore flow through an occluded catheter and prevent emergency surgery. ReFlow’s initial clinical evidence of flow restoration and reduction of symptoms via acute intervention flushing with follow-up up to 3 years, led neurosurgeons to evaluate ReFlow for prophylactic occlusion prevention in their high-risk patients. Ground-breaking clinical data, now out up to 2 years with 100% success, suggest ReFlow is safe for at-home, prophylactic flushing by patients or caregivers to extend shunt life and eliminate revision brain surgery. Supported by these encouraging results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ReFlow Breakthrough Device status in 2021, making it eligible for regulatory and reimbursement advantages. With existing profitable reimbursement, Anuncia plans to launch its next-generation ReFlow Mini product line in Q2 2022 and continue clinical studies to support market adoption and premium reimbursement. With Breakthrough status and strong health economic advantages to improve hospital quality metrics and support New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for rapid market adoption and premium pricing; Anuncia is positioned to be the leader in CSF management and help patients live fuller lives. ReFlow’s unique ability to improve patient access to noninvasive lifesaving therapy at home or in the clinic and to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life, and reduce healthcare costs, earned it an Honorable Mention in the Fast Company 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards and landed it on MDDI’s The Ultimate List of Private Companies to Watch.",Anuncia Medical is a CSF Management startup with an FDA Breakthrough Device platform to prevent shunt failure and revision brain surgery.,Arizona Tech Investors,Seed,"$1,000","$19,000",11-50,"Scottsdale, Arizona, United States",8,Feb 2018

As a specialized use case, Simbo is using its Gen AI platform for medical practice automation. It helps healthcare providers reduce burnout and costs, by automating mundane tasks using proprietary Lossless clinical NLU. Simbo AI is currently automating following use cases: - AI Medical Scribe as an API: Simbo sends patient conversation transcript to all well known LLMs from AWS, Azure, and open-source LLMs and uses proprietary clinical note ranking algorithm to identify the best clinical note. Our algorithm optimizes the cost as well to ensure it fits the budget. - Autonomous AI Phone triage bot: Triages the patients on inbound and outbound calls to autonomously resolve tasks. It helps reduce burden on healthcare staff and reduce cost for medical practice. Simbo has invented a groundbreaking concept known as 'Lossless NLU,' powered by our proprietary BISLU platform. Lossless NLU takes text or voice input and transforms it into a structured meaning representation called Thought Representations, without losing any part of the meaning. In contrast to prevailing NLU methods that primarily predict intent and entities, Lossless NLU retains the full context. We integrate Lossless NLU with Generative AI to eliminate hallucinations and perform fact checking.

Gaps in supply chain monitoring create vulnerabilities due to a lack of data distribution infrastructure. This causes supply chain management risks resulting in large overhead, compliance, audit, and error costs. This can be illustrated by numerous traceability issues and recalls causing: large amounts of waste, reduced consumer trust in products, and demand for increased transparency. In addition, food fraud and counterfeiting results in millions of people becoming ill and even the loss of lives in addition to immense economic losses. Other well-known issues in many supply chains include inventory management and demand prediction difficulties, resulting in excess working capital requirements. Legacy systems are focused on optimizing the internal operations of a company but fail to encompass the supply chain as a whole. This by default rules out the possibility of implementing solutions that require coordination and data sharing among the relevant stakeholders.
